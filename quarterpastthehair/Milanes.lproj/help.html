	<br>
	<h3>Features</h3>
	
	<p>
		At the moment the only feature is that FuzzyClock displays the current time in a "fuzzy" style
		in the menu bar. FuzzyClock has now no dock icon and no menu bar. Because of this a click to the

		tool tip with the current date/time. Move your mouse over the fuzzy time and find out ...
	</p>

	<p>
		The format of "Localizable.strings" has changed and is now more flexible to place the hourString on
		different positions.

		<ul>
			<li> Dutch
